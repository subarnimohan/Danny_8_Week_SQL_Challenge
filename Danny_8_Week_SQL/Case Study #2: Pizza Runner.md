# Overview

The exercise is part of the 8 Week SQL Challenge by Danny Ma. More information on the challenge can be found here: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/

# Introduction
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway…)

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

# Problem Statement

This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

Pizza Metrics
Runner and Customer Experience
Ingredient Optimisation
Pricing and Ratings
Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.


# Information

I have executed the solutions using DB Fiddle using **Schema (PostgreSQL v13)**

# Data Cleaning and Transformation

- From looking into the customer_orders table, you can observe that the exclusions and extras columns have 'null' values
- The first step is to replace 'null' values in the columns with '' by creating a temporary table that we would be using in this exercise


| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time               |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------ |

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS

SELECT order_id,customer_id,pizza_id,

CASE WHEN exclusions IS NULL or exclusions LIKE 'null' then '' else exclusions end as exclusions,
CASE WHEN extras IS NULL or extras='null' then '' ELSE extras end as extras,
order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
````

This is the temporary table that has been cleaned
